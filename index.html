<h3>1. How many quarters have you attended EvCC?<br>
	2. What degree/certificate program are you pursuing?<br>
	3. Why did you choose this degree/certificate?<br>
	4. What artist/designer inspires you? Why?<br>
	5. What is your favorite color?  (Please, use a hex code and style your answer with that color.)</h3>
<p>1. I've attended 2 quarters at EvCC! Not including this quarter.<br>
	2. I'm planning on pursuing a degree in web design, or more loosely, something well-transferable that is tech/design-based.<br>
	3. For me, it's logically a good path as the world changes and evolves, since technology is rapidly growing and I have an eye for art.<br>
	4. I'm inspired by a family friend named Ruth! She works in UX Design and I want to learn from her when I go job searching/enter internships.<br>
	<p style="color:#EBB8F5">5. My favorite color is a hard tie between pastel pink and green, partially because I just like the colors together as a pair.
